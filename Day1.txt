Day1 Of Learning C++
-------------------------------------

--Introducton--
Hello there, my name is Anshu Kumar Singh.
I am making this series of files as notes of my study of C++.
You can also use them.

This one is not a C++ file, but the forthcoming will be.
Today, we are just gonna know about some stuff.

The files of C++ have the extension .cpp and more but we'll mainly use .cpp.
We write code, it's called source code, then it can be converted into something 
called object code which is understood by our system/pc by the compiler.
With time there were multiple versions of C++ released with time.
C++98, C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20.
Mainly 11 and 14 are used, 17 is new(Yup, even in 2022) and 20 is even newer and is 
used by only a few programmers.

--Base Code--
The base code of C++ kinda looks like this-

-------
#include <iostream>

int main(){

    //code

    return 0;

}
-------

The "#include line" is a preprocessor directive. It swaps that line with the given file,
"<iostream>" is this case, before the file is processed by the compiler. The preprocessors
don't understand C++, they just swap. The file is understood and converted by the compiler.

After that comes "int main(){", here "main" is a function, every C++ program needs to have a 
"main" funcion. We'll learn creating function ahead some day. For now, just know that int means
integer and it declares that the "main" function needs to return an integer. A function needs to 
have those parenthesis. After that the curly braces show from where to where the main function
is from.

"//code" represents where the main code will be written. "return 0;' shows the function ends
returning "0" which is needed, without it, it will cause errors.

Different kinds of words exist in programming languages called, keywords(ex- if, do, not, etc.),
identifiers, punctuation and else. Together they create syntax. Different languages have different 
syntaxes. And if you do something wrong in the syntax it will cause errors. And one of the most 
important thing in C++ syntax is ";", it marks the end of a code statement.


--Comments--
Comments are lines in code that are ignored by compilers. They are to be read by other 
programmers. Small codes don't need explanation, but when you write long lines of code and use 
different types of algorithms, explanation is needed. 

"//" before a line. Make it a single line comment and 
"/*" represents the start of a multiline comment and the end is represents by "*/"

Ex- 
// text

Ex- 
/* text
text
text */

This is the end of this file now, and next time we will learn Inputting and Outputting.
