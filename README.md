# Learning-Cpp
Hey there guys,

I am currently learning C++ and I am making online notes. The files in this repo are my notes.

I am learning from Udemy, a course by the name "Beginning C++ Programming- From Beginning to Beyond".
It is by Tim Buchalka's Learning Programming Academy.
The Professor there is Dr. Frank Mitropoulos
You should really go for this course, I'm telling you it's great.

Some things to note-
The Day1, Day2 system is just used as a naming convention and it's not like I make one file a day, some take a couple when I don't get
the time. Sometimes I make multiple files a day, it's rare, but it's true.

The other thing is that......... Well, I forgot what it was, but it was something, I'll edit when I remember it.

Well, the course I was doing on Udemy has ended, and now I'm gonna start making some small projects. They'll be here soon.

Thank you Everyone,
Anshu Kumar Singh a.k.a. Sidam
