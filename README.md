# Learning-Cpp
Hey there guys,

The files in this repo are my notes of when I was learning C++.

I learned C++ from Udemy, a course by the name "Beginning C++ Programming- From Beginning to Beyond".
It is by Tim Buchalka's Learning Programming Academy.
The Professor there is Dr. Frank Mitropoulos

Some things to note-
The Day1, Day2 system is just used as a naming convention and it's not like I make one file a day, some take a couple when I don't get
the time. Sometimes I make multiple files a day.

I started learning C++ because it was heavily used in game-dev, then I heard about C# and Unity. By this time, my course was over. Hence,
I planned to move to C#. I made only three small practice programs and started learning C#. There I made pretty much all the Problem 
programs I have made here. And I also made the TicTacToe, which was great.

I don't know if anyone will every even read this, but if you are, Thank You.
