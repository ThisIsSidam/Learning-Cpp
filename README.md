# Learning-Cpp
Hey there guys,

I am currently learning C++ and I am making online notes. The files in this repo are my notes.

I am learning from Udemy, a course name "Learning C++ From beginning to beyond" Or something like this, Sorry, if I'm too wrong.
It is by Tim Buchalka's Learning Programming Academy
The Professor there is Dr. Frank Mitropoulos
You should really go for this course, I'm telling you it's great.

Some things to note-
The Day1, Day2 system is just used as a naming convention and it's not like I make one file a day, some take a couple when I don't get
the time. Sometimes I make multiple files a day, it's rare, but it's true.

The other thing is that......... Well, I forgot what it was, but it was something, I'll edit when I remember it.



Note: If anyone from the course is reading this, if you don't want me to post my notes of your paid course publicly like this, contact 
me and I'll make it private. I rarely open Github, so you can search ThisIsSidam on reddit, or you can just whatsapp me on this number
+91 7281070478. 

Thank you Everyone,
Anshu Kumar Singh a.k.a. Sidam
